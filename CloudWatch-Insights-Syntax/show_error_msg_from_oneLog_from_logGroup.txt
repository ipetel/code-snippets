'''
  This query is for display errors from only one log under log group.
  my use case was to analyze logs from DMS task and I wanted to look at each log separately.
  using filter on "@logStream" gives this option with filter on "@message" to display only errors ('E:')

'''

fields @log,@logStream,@timestamp, @message
| sort @timestamp asc
| filter @logStream like 'dms-task-ABC123' and @message like 'E:'
| limit 100
